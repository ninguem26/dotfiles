# Dotfiles
My i3wm dotfiles

## Installation

To configure i3wm you just need to run the `install.sh` file in the command line:
> ~$ ./install.sh

This will install all the libs necessary to make the i3 environment work.

### Dunst

For notifications to work, install the Dunst notification daemon, following the [docs](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst).

### Light

For screen back light control, install [Light](http://haikarainen.github.io/light/).

## Other tips

- Media control can present some problems if the output device code is diferent from the one in i3/config. If that happens, just change the code in it's respective lines.
